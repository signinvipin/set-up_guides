Host Server Setup:

sudo su

## Mirror Cmds Centos ##
sed -i 's/mirrorlist/#mirrorlist/g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
sed -i 's|#baseurl=http://mirror.centos.org|baseurl=http://vault.centos.org|g' /etc/yum.repos.d/CentOS-*
yum install epel-release -y

yum update -y

#> yum install python3.9
or,
#> Install python3.11 and pip3 directly as
$ yum install python3.11 python3.11-pip
 no need to set env variables in this case

Check installation
pip3 --version

# install ansible 
$ pip3 install ansible

#> Setup env variable path for ansible
$ vi ~/.bashrc
add,
export A_HOME=/usr/local
export PATH=$PATH:$A_HOME/bin
then,
$ source ~/.bashrc

or,

Check ansible installation
ansible --version

After Setup How-Tos
1. ansible-galaxy role delete <github_user> <github_repo>
Purpose: Deletes a role from Ansible Galaxy, the online repository.
Scope: Remote – This is an admin-level command used by the role owner (typically via API or web interface) to remove the role listing from the Galaxy website.
Effect: Once deleted, others can't download this role using ansible-galaxy install.
usage:
$ ansible-galaxy role delete myusername myrole

Note: You must be the owner of the GitHub repo or authorized user to do this.

2. ansible-galaxy remove <role_name>
Purpose: Removes a role from your local system, typically from ~/.ansible/roles/.
Scope: Local – Affects your environment only.
Effect: Deletes the installed role directory, freeing up space or cleaning up unused roles.
usage:
$ ansible-galaxy remove geerlingguy.apache

| Command                             | Affects        | Scope  | Use Case                                  |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------- |

| `ansible-galaxy remove <role_name>` | Local system   | Local  | Uninstall/remove a role from your machine |

Placement of roles:
Follow below structure. We can place project folder anywhere we want.
my-ansible-project/
├── playbook.yml
├── roles/
│   ├── common/
│   └── webserver/

Other than project folder ansible looks for roles under below locations:
System-wide (for all users): /etc/ansible/roles/
User-specific: ~/.ansible/roles/
